# Notification Logger [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/notification-logger.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/notification-logger)

Ever wondered why you have to open the console every time you want to want to log a variable?

Notification Logger helps provide desktop notification for your console messages.

During development, You have to check the browser's inspector periodically to see what your console.log()'s are saying.

With [notification-logger](https://github.com/hkirat/notification-logger/), you can develop and debug web apps and see console messages as Desktop Notifications.

And it only adds ~50 lines to your project.
